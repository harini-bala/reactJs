Dynamic-page-implementation

The app is a React-based web application where users can interact with a dynamic UI to view and manage data. It processes user actions, updates state, and renders components efficiently using Reactâ€™s state management. 

Level 0 (Context Diagram)
At the highest level, the system consists of a User interacting with the React Application to view and manage data.

|  External Entities    |
|                       |
|   - User              |

+------------------------+

Explanation:
External Entity (User): The user interacts with the React app by performing actions like clicking buttons, submitting forms, or navigating pages.
Process (React App): The application processes user input, updates components, and makes API calls if necessary.
Data Store (State / API / Database): Data is stored in local state (useState/Redux) or retrieved from an API/database for persistent storage.

Now, breaking down the React App into its specific functionalities:
+-----------------------+
|    External Entity    |
|        (User)        |
+-----------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Process: 1.1          |
|   Handle User Actions   |
+--------------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Data Store: State /   |
|    API / Database       |
+--------------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Process: 1.2          |
|   Update UI Display     |
+--------------------------+

Explanation:
Process 1.1 (Handle User Actions):
The user interacts with buttons, forms, or navigation.
React listens to events using onClick, onChange, or useEffect.
If needed, it sends data to an API or updates local state.
Data Store (State / API / Database):
The updated data is stored in React state (useState / useContext / Redux).
If needed, an API/database call is made using fetch() or axios.
Process 1.2 (Update UI Display):


The UI dynamically updates based on the new state.
The Virtual DOM ensures efficient rendering of changed components.
