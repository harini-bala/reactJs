5. ecommerce-store
The app is a React-based web application where users interact with a dynamic UI to view and manage data. It processes user actions, updates state, and renders components efficiently using Reactâ€™s state management.
Level 0 (Context Diagram):
At the highest level, the system consists of a User interacting with the React Application to view and manage data.

Explanation:
External Entity (User): The user interacts with the React app by performing actions like clicking buttons, submitting forms, or navigating pages.
Process (React App): The application processes user input, updates components, and makes API calls if necessary.
Data Store (State / API / Database): Data is stored in local state (useState / Redux) or retrieved from an API/database for persistent storage.

Now, breaking down the React App into its specific functionalities:
+-----------------------+
|    External Entity    |
|        (User)        |
+-----------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Process: 1.1          |
|   Browse Products       |
+--------------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Data Store:           |
|   Product Catalog       |
+--------------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Process: 1.2          |
|   Manage Shopping Cart  |
+--------------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Data Store:           |
|    Shopping Cart        |
+--------------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Process: 1.3          |
|   Place Order           |
+--------------------------+
          |
          v
+--------------------------+
|   Data Store:           |
|   Order Management      |
+--------------------------+
Explanation:
Process 1.1 (Browse Products): The user interacts with the application to view available products. The application retrieves product data from the Product Catalog data store and displays it to the user.
Process 1.2 (Manage Shopping Cart): The user adds or removes products from their shopping cart. The application updates the Shopping Cart data store accordingly.
Process 1.3 (Place Order): The user initiates the checkout process. The application processes the order, updates the Order Management data store, and potentially interacts with external payment gateways (not shown in this DFD).
